# Scriptable-Objects
Both Disco-sim and Weapon projects

Disco-Sim:
LightSim1: When you left click it turns the lights on and off, right click changes the colour of each light randomly.

LightSim2: When you right click it cycles through a random pattern of lights and displays the randomly selected set. When you middle mouse click it cycles randomly through all patterns, this will continue until middle mouse is clicked again. All lights are randomly coloured between each change of set/pattern.

Weapon Store:
When you run this scene it will load the game and the first weapon you will use is the light weapon. You click right click to shoot and there will be a delay between each shot represented by the cooldown UI. When you hold tab you will then be able to use the mouse to left click any of the buttons displayed on the right side. Each weapon has it's own relative cooldown and damage.
